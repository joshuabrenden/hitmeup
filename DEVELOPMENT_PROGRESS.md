## Development Notes

### Current Environment
- **Development Server:** http://localhost:3001
- **Database:** Supabase project `cwrukvjtckajyisedmlu`
- **RLS Status:** Temporarily disabled for development
- **Test Users:** Pre-created with known IDs for testing

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **RLS Temporarily Disabled:** Complex policies were causing infinite recursion, disabled for initial development phase
2. **Fixed UUIDs for Test Data:** Using predictable UUIDs for admin/test users to simplify development
3. **AI Message Structure:** Messages table supports both user messages and AI responses from Jimmy

### Next Session Setup
1. Ensure development server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Database connection should work immediately
3. Test endpoints available for verification
4. Ready to begin UI component development

## Testing Verification Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test database connection
curl http://localhost:3001/api/test-db

# Verify complete schema with test data
